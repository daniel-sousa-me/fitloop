Assisted Bodyweight Squat
Stand in front of a horizontal bar, handrail, or anything else that you can stably hold on to. Keep your legs approximately shoulder-width apart. Squat down while partially supporting your weight with your arms. In the squat, you should think of sitting backwards, not down. The knees should not move forward as you squat down. Check out how the shins of the guy in the video barely move at all and remain vertical at all times.
