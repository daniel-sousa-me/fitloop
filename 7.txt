Plank
Get in a plank position, keeping your core tight and your body straight. Be sure to flex your glutes. You should not be feeling this in your lower back, but your abdominal muscles. Hold for time. Make it harder by putting weight on your butt/lower back. If this plank position is too difficult to hold, go down onto the elbows instead of holding arms straight.To make it more difficult, elevate the feet so they are at shoulder height.
