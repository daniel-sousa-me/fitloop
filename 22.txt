Incline Row
If you don't have access to specialized gym equipment, this exercise can be performed in several different ways. Using the edge of a very sturdy table. Placing a pullup bar between two tables or chairs. Attaching rings or other rope-like attachments to a doorframe pullup bar. Whichever way you choose, make sure everything is sturdy and can hold your weight.
