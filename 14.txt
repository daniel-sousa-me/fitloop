Stomach-to-Wall Handstand Practice
5 minutes of handstand practice. Set a timer for 5 minutes and do handstands, resting as long as you need. Rest is included in time. Make sure you have an exit strategy, so you don't get stuck or fall down. If you don't feel comfortable with this exercise, then skip it until you better understand it and are more able.
