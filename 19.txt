Pushup
Get into a Plank position, with your hands directly below your shoulders. Lower yourself so that your chest touches the ground, and push yourself back up. The core should be tight, keeping the body straight. The elbows should be kept back if possible, do not allow them to splay out more than 45 degrees from the body.
