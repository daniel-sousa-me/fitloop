Arch
While lying prone, lift your arms (and chest) and legs (including thighs) off the ground. The more you engage your back muscles and glutes, the greater your spine will arch. 
This bodyline drill is commonly one of the slowest to progress with so don't feel bad if you feel it's uncomfortable and awkward. 
You'll often see it done with arms overhead, but to make it easier, you can point them back (toward your feet) while still lifting the chest.
